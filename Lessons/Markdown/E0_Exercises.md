### Exercise 0
#### Odd or Even

Write a function that checks whether the input is odd or even. Then, find another way of doing this.

<br/>

### Exercise 1
#### Project Euler Problem 7

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

What might be the fastest way of doing this?

### Exercise 2
#### Exclusive-Or

The Exclusive-Or (XOR) operation has the truth table

| XOR   | True  | False |
|-------|-------|-------|
| True  | False | True  |
| False | True  | False |

In other words, XOR returns true if and only if one but not both of the inputs is true. 

Write a function `XOR(a, b)` that performs this task.
