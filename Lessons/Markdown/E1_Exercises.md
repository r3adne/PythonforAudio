### Exercise 3
#### Loading Audio Files

In python, we can load audio files using Librosa. Using the file `E1_3.py`, print out the first 10 samples of the audio file.


### Exercise 4
#### Measuring RMS

RMS is a measurment of audio loudness. It stands for Root-Mean-Squared, and it's quite similar to how it sounds. 

The RMS value of a series of audio samples is the square root of the mean of the squares of each sample. 

Using `E1_4.py`, write a function that:

1. Takes a series of audio samples as an input; and
2. Returns the RMS value for those audio samples.


### Exercise 5 
#### Statistical analysis

Using `E1_5.py`, print out a statistical analysis of the RMS values of several audio clips. 

Provide the mean and median RMS and the standard deviation of the dataset.

Then, print the names of any files that are more than one standard deviation from the mean. 



### Exercise 6
#### Sorting

Using `E1_6.py`, write a function that:

1. Takes a list as an input; and
2. Returns the list sorted in ascending order. 

Do not use sorted(), list.sort(), or any other third-party sorting method. 

There are many ways to do this, don't worry about speed for the time being.



#### Exercise 7
#### Manhattan Distance

*Manhattan Distance* is the term used to describe not the absolute distance between two points, but the distance it would take to travel between two points on a grid such as the streets of New York.

Using `E1_7.py`, Write a function that:

1. Has two list arguments, a and b, which each contain the x-and y- coordinates for a point; and
2. Returns the Manhattan distance between these two points
