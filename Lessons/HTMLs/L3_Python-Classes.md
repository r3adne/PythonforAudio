<p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> is a complicated-sounding term for a very simple idea: Programming that represents the way we look at the world. To flesh out the need for Object-Oriented Programming, let's look at a program that keeps track of a user's bank account balance:</p>

<pre><code># the first character of each variable is the identity of the user. 

a_balance = 1000
a_inDebt = False
a_memos = ["this is the first memo"]

def a_withdraw(amount, memo):
    a_balance -= amount

    if a_balance &lt; 0:
        print('a in debt')
        a_inDebt = True
    else:
        a_inDebt = False

    a_memos.append(memo)
    print('withdrew from a')

def a_deposit(amount, memo):
    a_balance += amount
    print('a added to their balance')
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's add another client to our accounts list:</p>

<pre><code># the first character of each variable is the identity of the user. 

a_balance = 1000
a_inDebt = False
a_memos = ["this is the first memo"]

b_balance = 1000
b_inDebt = False
b_memos = ["this is the first memo"]


def a_withdraw(amount, memo):
    a_balance -= amount

    if a_balance &lt; 0:
        print('a in debt')
        a_inDebt = True
    else:
        a_inDebt = False

    a_memos.append(memo)
    print('withdrew from a')

def a_deposit(amount, memo):
    a_balance += amount
    print('a added to their balance')

def b_withdraw(amount, memo):
    b_balance -= amount

    if b_balance &lt; 0:
        print('b in debt')
        b_inDebt = True
    else:
        b_inDebt = False

    b_memos.append(memo)
    print('withdrew from b')

def b_deposit(amount, memo):
    b_balance += amount
    print('b added to their balance')
</code></pre>

<p>We can see that continuing to add clients would prove difficult. Now, in reality, we wouldn't actually write a program like this. A more refined example might be: </p>

<pre><code>accountNumbers = [] # a list of all active account numbers
balances = {} # account number : balance
inDebt = {} # account number : Debt Status (Boolean)

def withdraw(accountNumber, amount):
    # withdraws amount from accountNumber
    balances[accountNumber] -= amount

    if balances[accountNumber] &lt; 0: # is accountNumber in debt? 
        print('%d in debt'%(accountNumber))
        inDebt[accountNumber] = True

def deposit(accountNumber, amount):
    # deposits amount into accountNumber
    balances[accountNumber] += amount

    if balances[accountNumber] &gt;= 0:
        inDebt[accountNumber] = False


def addAccount(accountNumber, initialAmount):
    accountNumbers.append(accountNumber)
    balances[accountNumber] = initialAmount
    inDebt[accountNumber] = False
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, what we're trying to do here is reframe the program around the account holders. This makes sense to us because in the real world we consider each thing we experience as an object. </p>
