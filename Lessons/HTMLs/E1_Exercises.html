<h3>Exercise 3</h3>

<h4>Loading Audio Files</h4>

<p>In python, we can load audio files using Librosa. Using the file <code>E1_3.py</code>, print out the first 10 samples of the audio file.</p>

<h3>Exercise 4</h3>

<h4>Measuring RMS</h4>

<p>RMS is a measurment of audio loudness. It stands for Root-Mean-Squared, and it's quite similar to how it sounds. </p>

<p>The RMS value of a series of audio samples is the square root of the mean of the squares of each sample. </p>

<p>Using <code>E1_4.py</code>, write a function that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Takes a series of audio samples as an input; and</li>
<li>Returns the RMS value for those audio samples.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Exercise 5</h3>

<h4>Statistical analysis</h4>

<p>Using <code>E1_5.py</code>, print out a statistical analysis of the RMS values of several audio clips. </p>

<p>Provide the mean and median RMS and the standard deviation of the dataset.</p>

<p>Then, print the names of any files that are more than one standard deviation from the mean. </p>

<h3>Exercise 6</h3>

<h4>Sorting</h4>

<p>Using <code>E1_6.py</code>, write a function that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Takes a list as an input; and</li>
<li>Returns the list sorted in ascending order. </li>
</ol>

<p>Do not use sorted(), list.sort(), or any other third-party sorting method. </p>

<p>There are many ways to do this, don't worry about speed for the time being.</p>

<h4>Exercise 7</h4>

<h4>Manhattan Distance</h4>

<p><em>Manhattan Distance</em> is the term used to describe not the absolute distance between two points, but the distance it would take to travel between two points on a grid such as the streets of New York.</p>

<p>Using <code>E1_7.py</code>, Write a function that:</p>

<ol>
<li>Has two list arguments, a and b, which each contain the x-and y- coordinates for a point; and</li>
<li>Returns the Manhattan distance between these two points</li>
</ol>
